      <h2>Gameplay:</h2>
      <p>
        On each player's turn, they select one of their pits to move stones from. The contents of the selected pit are distributed into the other pits, moving counterclockwise.
        If a player's final stone lands in their own goal, they get to make another move.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a player's final stone lands in an empty pit on their side, and there are stones in the opposing pit on the other player's side, all of these stones are added to the player's goal pit.
      </p>
      <p>
        If one player is unable to move, the other player repeatedly moves until the other player has moves available.
      </p>
      <h2>Ending the Game:</h2>
      <p>
        If neither player has any valid moves (all of the stones are in one player's goal or the other), the game is over. Count out the stones in each player's goal pit. The player with the most stones is the winner!
